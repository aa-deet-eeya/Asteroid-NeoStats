# Asteroid NeoStats

A simple project which fetches and displays data from https://api.nasa.gov/neo/?api_key=DEMO_KEY
This project was made in React and Bootstrap.

Users can select the date in between they want to view the Asteroids
(Note: NASA NeoWs serves details of asteroids between 7 days only. Which means start and end date can be at maximum 7 days apart)
